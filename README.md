DiShelved is a management app for Item Collections. Whether it's Board Games, Miniatures or Holiday Decorations - DiShelved makes it simple for Users to manage where their Items are stored.
</p>

## ✨ Features
- Sign-in to save your own collection data
- List new Locations to display where your items are being kept
- Place new Containers in each Location to hold items in
- Add Items to your Containers! Provide Names, Descriptions and Images for each item to keep track of them
- You may also indicate the quantity of an Item(s) and whether or not it is missing any pieces

## 😊 User Description
DiShelved is designed with Item Collectors in mind. A key user would be someone with a large collection of Items such as games or collectables that needs managing.
This is why the Items will indicate whether they are complete or if there are more than one in the collection.
Though the app is built with Collectables in mind, it could also be used by anyone looking to keep track of their belongings, such as furniture, books and more.
